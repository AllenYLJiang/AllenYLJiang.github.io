title: "Multi-target Anomaly Detection using Drone-based platforms with Invariant Physical Rules Embedded"
excerpt: "Sponsored by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) 
Under unideal environments, the visual features of objects cannot be completely obtained due to interferences such as occlusions and motion blur, even traditional spatio-temporal approach cannot recover missing features under long-term occlusions. To tackle this problem, we propose to utilize the invariant properties, such as structures and motion properties, in obtaining the complete features of objects. Invariant properties are combined with variant visual features.
