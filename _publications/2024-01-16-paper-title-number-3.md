excerpt: 'Video anomaly detection is a challenging task due to the unpredictable nature of abnormal actions, sophisticated semantics and a lack in training data. The visual representations of most existing approaches are limited by short-term sequences which cannot provide necessary clues for achieving reasonable detections. In this paper, we propose to comprehensively represent the motion patterns in human actions by learning from long-term sequences. Firstly, a Stacked State Machine (SSM) model with distinctive basis functions is proposed to represent the temporal dependencies which are consistent across long-term observations. Secondly, the dependencies are leveraged in filtering out problematic motion estimations which are influenced by short-term observation noises, plausible motion parameters are obtained in this way. Finally, SSM model predicts future states based on past ones, the divergence between the predictions with inherent normal patterns and observed ones determines anomalies which violate normal motion patterns. To address the challenges in drone-based surveillance, a dataset which is more diversified than existing ones is built. Extensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed approach on the dataset and existing ones. Improvements over state-of-the-art methods can be observed.<br />
