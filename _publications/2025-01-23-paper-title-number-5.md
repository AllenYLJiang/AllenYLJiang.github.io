excerpt: 'Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify novel actions or events which are unseen during training. Existing mainstream VAD techniques typically focus on the global patterns with redundant details and struggle to generalize to unseen samples. In this paper, we propose a framework that identifies the local patterns which generalize to novel samples and models the dynamics of local patterns. The capability of extracting spatial local patterns is achieved through a two-stage process involving  image-text alignment and cross-modality attention. Generalizable representations are built by focusing on semantically relevant components which can be recombined to capture the essence of novel anomalies, reducing unnecessary visual data variances. To enhance local patterns with temporal clues, we propose a State Machine Module (SMM) that utilizes earlier high-resolution textual tokens to guide the generation of precise captions for subsequent low-resolution observations. Furthermore, temporal motion estimation complements spatial local patterns to detect anomalies characterized by novel spatial distributions or distinctive dynamics. Extensive experiments on popular benchmark datasets demonstrate the achievement of state-of-the-art performance. <br />
